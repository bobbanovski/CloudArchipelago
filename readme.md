## Cloud Archipelago - Built on SmartAdmin 1.8 template

- I am a developer currently focused on all aspects of back end programming from developing the business logic to ensuring data persistence in a SQL database via the ORM Entity Framework, to presenting the results of processing in visually appealing and appropriate graphs.

- To provide a visually appealing GUI for the business logic the template SmartAdmin 1.8 was purchased and heavily modified into the multifunctional app you see now

- Thanks for looking at my app,
Robert
